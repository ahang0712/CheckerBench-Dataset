# Task: Synthesize a CSA Checker from a CVE Patch

## Your Role

You are a static analysis expert. Synthesize a Clang Static Analyzer (CSA) checker
that detects the bug pattern fixed by the CVE patch in this working directory.

You have full filesystem and bash access — use them.

### Skills

Many skills are available under `.claude/skills/` — covering vulnerability analysis,
checker design, debugging, code audit, security patterns, and more.  Each skill
encodes reusable expertise: take time to explore them, read their SKILL.md files,
and invoke those that look useful via the Skill tool.  Let the task guide which
ones you reach for.

## Resources

**Read these before writing any code:**

1. **`references/csa_headers_api.md`** — CSA API quick reference. Extracted directly from
   LLVM 18 headers. Covers all checker callbacks, ProgramState operations, SVal types,
   MemRegion hierarchy, and bug reporting. **Read this first whenever you need API info.**

2. **`references/csa_checker_patterns.md`** — Pattern catalog. Documents 5 battle-tested
   patterns from official LLVM checkers: resource tracking, null checking, undefined
   value detection, division-by-zero, and malloc/free. Each pattern includes skeleton
   code, state traits, and key API usage.

3. **`references/examples/llvm-official/`** — 5 official LLVM 18 checker implementations
   with explanatory comments:
   - `01_div_zero.cpp` — simplest checker (169 lines, 1 callback)
   - `02_simple_stream.cpp` — resource tracking (292 lines, fopen/fclose)
   - `03_undef_result.cpp` — PostStmt pattern (160 lines)
   - `04_nullability.cpp` — multi-callback checker (1247 lines)
   - `05_malloc.cpp` — comprehensive malloc/free (1511 lines)

4. **`checker_template.cpp`** — Skeleton with placeholders. Start here.

5. **`references/repo_knowledge.md`** — Project-specific reference. Contains this
   repository's memory allocation API, key data types, source layout, and typical
   CVE patterns. **Read this before writing the checker** — knowing the project's
   alloc/free conventions and common bug patterns saves many grep rounds.

5b. **`references/patterns_summary.md`** — (may not exist) Historical synthesis
   patterns for this project.  If present, it contains a concise summary of the
   most common bug patterns, frequent CWE categories, and reusable checker
   architectures observed in previous synthesis runs.  Read after repo_knowledge.md.

6. **`references/cwe_cards/`** — Complete CWE knowledge base covering all
   vulnerability categories.  **The framework provides the full library —
   you must identify the vulnerability type yourself.**  Workflow:

   1. Analyse the patch diff and commit message to determine the vulnerability
      type (buffer overflow, UAF, null deref, integer overflow, race condition,
      etc.).  Do NOT rely on the CWE label — treat it as a hint at most.
   2. Open ``index.json`` to discover available cards and their tiers.
   3. Read the relevant card(s) for **detection strategies**, **checker
      architecture suggestions**, and **known false-positive patterns**.

   Card tiers:
   - ``CWE-{id}(-{variant}).md`` — Tier 1/2 cards for common CWEs; kernel /
     userspace variants when the detection strategy differs substantially.
   - ``Category-{name}.md`` — Tier 3 umbrella cards grouping rarer CWEs by
     category (input validation, resource management, etc.).

7. **`references/csa_utility_functions.h`** — Copy-paste C++ helper functions for
   checker.cpp. Includes AST traversal (`findSpecificTypeInParents/Children`),
   expression evaluation (`EvaluateExprToInt`, `inferSymbolMaxVal`), array/string
   size extraction, MemRegion helpers, and `ExprHasName()` for robust function
   matching. All verified against LLVM 18. **Read before implementing detection
   logic** — these save writing boilerplate that's easy to get wrong.

## Environment

Key paths are in ``config.json``.

### Pre-built scripts

| Script | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `bash compile.sh` | Compile checker.cpp → checker.so (with correct flags) |
| `CHECKER_NAME=<name> bash scan/scan_before.sh` | Scan before_commit, count warnings → N_buggy |
| `CHECKER_NAME=<name> bash scan/scan_after.sh` | Scan after_commit, count warnings → N_patched |

```bash
# Compile (run from workdir root)
bash compile.sh

# Scan — set CHECKER_NAME to the string passed to addChecker<>()
CHECKER_NAME=your.CheckerName bash scan/scan_before.sh   # → N_buggy
CHECKER_NAME=your.CheckerName bash scan/scan_after.sh    # → N_patched
```

- ``compile.sh`` already has the correct ``-I`` / ``-fno-rtti`` flags.
- ``scan/scan_*.sh`` count only warnings tagged with your checker name.
- Scan environments (source files + compile flags) are pre-built in ``scan/``.

### Scan Script Integrity (CRITICAL)

The scan scripts (``scan/scan_before.sh``, ``scan/scan_after.sh``) are the **only
valid measurement** of N_buggy and N_patched.  They are the ground truth that the
Python-side validator will also use.  You MUST obey these rules:

**1. Never bypass the scan scripts.**  Do NOT run ``clang --analyze`` directly
   to measure warning counts.  The Python validator runs the same scan scripts
   — if you measured with a different command, your numbers will not reproduce
   and the synthesis will be rejected.

**2. If the scan script prints COMPILE_ERROR** (missing headers, undeclared
   identifiers, etc.), the scan environment needs repair.  You MUST fix it:
   - Add missing ``-I`` include paths to the flags files in ``scan/``
   - Copy needed generated headers (e.g. ``autoconf.h``) from the snapshot
   - If the file fundamentally cannot be compiled by clang, stop and write
     ``summary.json`` with ``status: "failed"`` and an honest ``failure_reason``

**3. Only trust scan script output.**  The ``Total <name> warnings: N`` line
   printed by the scan script is the number that goes into ``summary.json``.
   If the scan script says 0, write 0.  Fabricating numbers that the scan
   script did not produce will cause the Python validator to reject the
   synthesis.

- If compile fails: read the error, fix ``checker.cpp``, retry (max 3 cycles).
- If validation fails: revise checker logic, re-compile, re-scan.

## MCP Tools

You have access to 3 MCP tools under the `csa-tools` server (prefixed `mcp__csa-tools__`).
Each returns **source context embedded in the result** — no need to follow up with Read.

| Tool | What it does | Key advantage |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `search(pattern, scope)` | Search for a pattern in source / LLVM headers / workdir | Returns file:line + 3 lines context — grep + Read in one call |
| `compile()` | Run compile.sh, return parsed diagnostics | Errors include checker.cpp context — fix without reading the file |
| `scan(checker_name)` | Run before/after scan, return N_buggy + N_patched + warning locations | Each warning includes source context — no manual clang --analyze needed |

### When to use each

- **`search`**: Whenever you would type `grep -rn "X"` or `find ... -name`. Use `scope="source"` for CVE code, `scope="llvm"` for CSA API headers, `scope="all"` when unsure.
- **`compile`**: Instead of `bash compile.sh` followed by reading checker.cpp at error lines.
- **`scan`**: Instead of running scan_before.sh + scan_after.sh + manual clang inspection. Returns everything you need to decide next action.

## Semantic Design Contract — before writing checker.cpp

Create the analysis portions of `state.json` and `scope_statement.md` **before**
writing checker.cpp. They are a design contract, not a retrospective summary.
After compilation, update only implementation facts such as `build_attempts`.

In `patch_analysis`, distinguish the vulnerable operation, its trigger, and the
semantic fact introduced by the patch that makes it safe. In `detection_plan`,
make `report_condition`, `safe_condition`, and `source_level_signal` concrete
CSA-observable facts. In `api_choice`, record the mechanism level and explain
why the selected callback can observe and prove those facts.

In `scope_statement.md`, include this mapping table and check it again after
implementation:

| Semantic condition | CSA evidence | checker.cpp implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| report condition | AST / SVal / MemRegion / CFG evidence | callback, helper, and branch that reports |
| safe condition | path constraint, guard, state discharge, or structural fact | branch that suppresses the report |

Every condition in the plan must have an implementation entry. Do not claim a
condition that checker.cpp does not implement, and do not silently add a code
condition absent from the plan.

## Mechanism Selection — diagnose before coding

Choose the weakest CSA mechanism that can prove the vulnerability property:

1. **syntax-only AST**: only when local AST shape itself is the defect;
2. **control flow / dominance**: when guard placement relative to a sink matters;
3. **path-sensitive ProgramState/SVal**: when an unsafe state must reach a use;
4. **cross-procedure/dataflow**: when the required fact crosses function boundaries.

For a guard-based patch, prove both that the guard rejects the unsafe value and
that it dominates the vulnerable use. For path-sensitive or cross-procedure
defects, do not replace the required state or flow proof with local AST matching
or source-text substring matching merely because it passes the differential scan.
Record the selected level as `api_choice.mechanism_level`.

## Semantic identity, locality, and final validation

Before accepting the checker, verify that its primary matching logic does not
depend on patch-local variable names, labels, line numbers, commit IDs, or unique
literals. Project APIs, types, and stable semantic call relationships are valid
scope anchors when they define the vulnerability class. Attach the report to the
actual vulnerable operation, and implement every suppression as a real safe
condition rather than the mere presence of a nearby guard-shaped statement.

The required final sequence is: **compile → before scan → after scan → inspect
the final checker name, artifacts, and report locations → write summary.json**.
Always run the final compile and both scans. `MAX_IN_SESSION_REDESIGNS` limits only
additional redesign cycles after a failed validation; if it is zero, preserve the
real validation evidence and report failure honestly rather than fabricating counts.

## Validation Criteria

```
VALID   : N_buggy > N_patched  AND  N_patched < 50
INVALID : otherwise → revise and re-validate (max 1 attempts)
```

## Refinement

Do NOT self-refine the checker repeatedly. Your goal is to produce the first
checker that passes the Validation Criteria above — fix compile errors and
validation failures only. False positives are triaged and repaired by the
framework's refinement stage: you will receive a concrete FP list via
session resume (if needed) and fix only those. Reserve budget for that stage.

## Output

Produce all of the following **only when completely done**:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| ``checker.cpp`` | Synthesized checker source code |
| ``checker.so`` | Compiled checker plugin |
| ``state.json`` | Structured task state (see schema below) |
| ``scope_statement.md`` | Checker scope analysis in prose (Level 1/2/3) |
| ``summary.json`` | Final report (see schema below) |

Writing ``summary.json`` signals completion.  Do NOT write it early.

### ``state.json``

Create this before writing checker.cpp to capture the design contract. After the
checker compiles, update only implementation facts and retain the original
semantic plan.

## Feedback-derived requirements for this fresh synthesis

A prior independent rollout exposed the risks below. Start again from the patch
in this new session. Do not reconstruct, edit, or assume the prior checker.

Required mechanism level: `control_flow`

### Current failure diagnosis

- Refinement was not accepted because the prior semantic rationale remained partial despite successful compilation and differential validation.
- A sysctl_ field-name prefix alone does not prove that a field is shared and concurrently writable, so the rollout could diagnose ordinary fields for which no race is possible.
- Volatile qualification was treated as equivalent to READ_ONCE protection, but the evidence states that volatile does not generally provide READ_ONCE concurrency semantics.
- The successful before/after result established correlation with the patch but did not by itself prove the full vulnerable read, concurrent-write, and missing-protection relation.

### Preserve from prior rollouts

- Preserve successful checker compilation, before/after validation, and code verification.
- Preserve objective eligibility gate G6.
- Preserve at least the previously adequate CSA mechanism level; the new control-flow design must not reduce the decision procedure to weaker patch matching.
- Preserve the semantic score at or above the configured threshold.
- Preserve process quality at or above the configured threshold.
- Remain independent of patch anchors.
- Remain free of patch-local hardcoding.

### Required semantic proof

- Establish that an evaluated load of a kernel sysctl-backed shared field is reachable and controls or contributes to behavior in the analyzed function.
- Require evidence stronger than the sysctl_ prefix alone that the field represents a concurrently writable sysctl knob.
- Establish that the relevant load is not governed by READ_ONCE or an equivalent kernel one-access read annotation in its macro-expansion ancestry.
- Do not classify a read as safe solely because its lvalue type is volatile-qualified.
- Exclude pure write destinations from the read-side report while preserving reads embedded in compound, conditional, or otherwise evaluated expressions.

### Implementation constraints

- Use a CSA statement callback that observes evaluated MemberExpr reads, with CFG reachability or an equivalent control-flow relationship used before reporting.
- Use Clang AST declarations and SourceManager/Lexer macro-expansion APIs rather than source-text substring matching.
- Classify read versus write context structurally, accounting for parentheses, implicit casts, compound assignments, increments, and nested expressions rather than checking only an immediate plain-assignment parent.
- Emit the diagnostic at the vulnerable field load and attach its source range; do not report at a function entry, macro definition, or unrelated control-flow node.
- Keep analysis project-general without embedding fib_select_multipath, sysctl_fib_multipath_use_neigh, fib_semantics.c, changed line numbers, or diff literals.
- Do not rely on ProgramState to simulate cross-CPU interleavings that are not represented in the analyzed execution path.
- Use only concurrency evidence observable from the supplied kernel source and preprocessing structure; do not infer concurrent writability from naming convention alone.

### Validation checklist

- Compile the checker as a loadable CSA plugin with the target Clang analyzer API and verify registration succeeds.
- Scan the vulnerable source and confirm diagnostics are produced for the reachable plain load in fib_select_multipath.
- Scan the patched source and confirm the READ_ONCE-wrapped load produces no diagnostic.
- Confirm every vulnerable diagnostic is located on the field access at the changed statement and that no warning appears outside the patched function in the paired scan.
- Add a relevant negative case showing that an unrelated sysctl_-prefixed field without evidence of concurrent sysctl backing is not reported.
- Add a negative case showing that a READ_ONCE-protected read through nested macro-argument expansion is recognized.
- Add a refinement case showing that bare volatile qualification does not automatically suppress an otherwise proven unsafe read.
- Add read/write-context cases covering plain assignment, compound assignment, increment, and a field read used in a branch condition.

### Avoid and forbidden regressions

- Do not restore the blanket rule that every sysctl_-prefixed FieldDecl is necessarily shared and concurrently writable.
- Do not use volatile qualification as a general substitute for READ_ONCE or as an unconditional safety exemption.
- Do not treat before/after warning disappearance alone as proof that all emitted reports represent real races.
- Do not match raw source text, filenames, function names, the patched field name, line numbers, or nearby patch tokens.
- Do not report unevaluated references or pure store destinations as vulnerable reads.
- Do not claim that single-path symbolic execution observes the concurrent writer or cross-CPU interleaving.

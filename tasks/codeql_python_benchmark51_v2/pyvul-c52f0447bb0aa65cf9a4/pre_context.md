# Patch-overlapping Python context before the fix

## `src/transformers/utils/hub.py` — `function:download_url` (lines 561-584)

```python
def download_url(url, proxies=None):
    """
    Downloads a given url in a temporary file. This function is not safe to use in multiple processes. Its only use is
    for deprecated behavior allowing to download config/models with a single url instead of using the Hub.

    Args:
        url (`str`): The url of the file to download.
        proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
            A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
            'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}.` The proxies are used on each request.

    Returns:
        `str`: The location of the temporary file where the url was downloaded.
